# BurgerBoss
An Attempt at making the game "Burger Boss" from the TV show Bob's Burgers in Unity

I would like to note quite importantly that I claim no ownership over anything in this project. I may have worked on almost all of the artwork and music in order to get it into the game, but it pretty much all came as a direct copy of what was featured in the episode of Bob's Burgers. (Which can be purchased on Youtube Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUG4ViPfCIM") But essentially this is a project for fun, as fan art, and not in any way intended for commercial distribution or compensation for me. It would just be cool if people played it.
